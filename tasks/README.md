This directory contains implementations of 'tasks'. A task in this codebase is something that utilizes some version of the model and the data, and runs at the end of each epoch. Every task inherts from the `task.py` base class, and defines a function `run(cls, model, criterion, epoch, args)` that returns a dictionary of tuples, where the tuple consists of a 'score name' and a score, similarly to the metric class. The `video_task.py` implements video-level evaluation, and uses metrics defined by '--video-metrics'.
